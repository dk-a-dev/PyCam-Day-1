### Numpy Intro:
- Numpy: Numerical Python
- Numpy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant.
- Numpy is a library for working with arrays of data.
- It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- It contains other things:
    - a powerful N-dimensional array object
    - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
    - Besides its obvious scientific uses, Numpy can also be used as an efficient

- Numpy arrays are similar to Python lists.
- Numpy arrays are faster and more memory efficient than Python lists.
- It is efficient because it uses contiguous memory allocation,unlike Python lists which use pointers.
- Numpy arrays are homogeneous, i.e. all elements of a particular array have the same data type.
- It has all the functionalities of a list and more.
