# PyCamp: Exploring Python libraries
A two-day hands-on and interactive session brought to you by IEEE-VIT

## Day-1-Session Flow:
<Todo>

## Setup for Hands-On:
1. Have Python 3.8+ installed on your system, check by running `python --version` in your terminal
2. Make sure if pip is installed on your system by running `pip --version` in your terminal
3. Open the directory where you want to work on the hands-on, or u can clone the repo using `git clone <github-url-of-repo>`
4. Setup a virtual environment, make sure to open the terminal in the directory where you want to work on the hands-on:
    #### Windows:
    > python -m venv .venv

    > .venv\Scripts\activate

    > clear
    
    #### Linux/MacOS:
    > python3 -m venv .venv

    > source .venv/bin/activate


5. Install the required packages:
    >`pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
    > clear
    
    **Note**: if u have cloned the repo then run this command directly and if not then [head over](https://github.com/dk-a-dev/PyCamp) to the repo and download the requirements.txt file
    

6. You are all set to go!
